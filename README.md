# codecademy
these are all the projects i completed using codecademy. most of it is python but i also completed their html/css lessons

if you know anything about codecademy, you'll know that their projects give you starter code most of the time and they'll tell you in steps what to do next to complete a very
specific project. i honestly didn't really like codecademy because i felt like i wasn't really learning anything about how to be a programmer, it was basically just telling me to
memorize a bunch of stuff all at once. i kept at it though, for quite a while so these are all the projects i completed there. 

note: i didn't write every single line of code all on my own (mostly for the html and css projects which is why it says this repository is mostly css, it techincally is but i didn't write all the css, i wrote pretty much all the python) but i definitely wrote more of this than the code in my skillshare projects.
i started using codecademy around july/august of 2021 but didn't really focus on it until the last couple months of 2021 and beginning of 2022. it is now january 28th 2022 and i
am no longer interested in using codecademy. i've started using the odin project and that is the tool i will be using for the foreseeable future.
